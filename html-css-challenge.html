      <h3>HTML Summary</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the heart of every webpage. It
        defines the structure of the webpage and annotates the content to tell
        the browser what to display and provide extra meaning. Without HTML,
        text would always be "just text" - there would be no semantic difference
        between titles, normal text, subtitles etc. You also wouldn't be able to
        add images or links.

      <h3>CSS Summary</h3>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that allows you to define
        style definitions for your HTML document. These definitions will be
        picked up by the browser and control how the content will be displayed
        (e.g. that some text is red, which font size it should have etc.).
